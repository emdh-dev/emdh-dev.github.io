          <br><br><b>YouTube Loop Repeater</b> is a browser extension that lets you loop specified parts of YouTube videos,
          and then play them back as many times as you want! Change settings like playback speed and loop amount.

          <br><br>
          Two ways to loop!
          <br>
          <b>Static:</b> Play a loop at a constant, specified speed. Just control how many times it repeats!
          <br><b>Incremental:</b> Play a loop at a changing speed, after it repeats a specified amount of times. The speed can either increase or decrease, until you reach a desired speed!

          <br><br>
          All played loops get saved to storage for easy access later. They're saved into two different areas:
          <br>
          <b>Current Loops Table:</b> These only show up if the video you're on has loops saved. Switch between different saved loops!
          <br>
          <b>All Video Loops Table:</b> Every loop you've saved is shown here. Easily navigate between any loop you have saved across all your loops.
          
          <br><br>
          Loops can be deleted at any time, and will be immediately removed from both tables.
          <br>
          ONLY FOR USE ON YOUTUBE. Does not work on other websites.

          <br><br><br>
          When I play guitar or drums, I usually play along to songs on YouTube. Part of this proecess, when learning new songs,
          is clicking back to certain timestamps and constantly replaying parts until I'm playing them perfectly.
          Even though it seems like an easy, negligible action to have to do, it interrupts the flow of practicing.
          Doing this means you have to take your hands off your instrument, move close to the computer, navigate back to the timestamp, and click.
          This gets really repetitive and annoying, especially if the part you're playing is only a few seconds long.
          It means that you'll never be able to fully immerse yourself in this practice, as you'll be constantly between your instrument and your computer.
          
          <br><br>
          Trying to practice other songs makes the problem worse, as you're always messing with timestamps and playback speed to figure out what part you're trying to play.
          YouTube also only allows for specific playback speed settings. This used to be in increments of 0.25 when this extension was started, but has been changed to be increments of 0.05 now.
          Getting anything smaller and more specific is possible with minor scripting.
          This is a static playback speed, and will only change if you want to change it.
          
          <br><br>
          When playing a part of a song, or doing anything else for the first time, you will have to follow at a slower speed.
          As you build confidence and ability, you will be able to increase your speed.
          YouTube does not allow this by default. As far as I saw, there are no other Chrome extensions that allow for this either.
          The only other place I've seen something like this is the Riff Repeater in Rocksmith, where you pick sections of a song,
          the speed you start at, and how many times in a row you have to play it correctly for it to continue speeding up.
          I love how Riff Repeater works, and it's changed how I practice playing any instrument. It gives you consistent and steady progress, which is hard to get otherwise.
          <br>
          And that is why I made this extension! To be able to learn challenging songs in a much easier, less manual way.
          <br><br>
          Spotify functionality was originally planned, but there were some complications figuring out how to implement it.
          It was also going to significantly more work to add it (need a new entry in the local storage object to specify the source,
          and also Spotify's Web Player is single-page, so there are not specific URLs for the songs.
          It would've required some automated actions to find the song via search and then clicking on it, which could look suspicious and alert some users).
          I was also getting pretty tired of working on the extension and increasing the scope when YouTube was already working, so I went and released it.
          This was the last project I wanted to release before going back to working full-time, so I was eager to get it done.
          If not, it could've easily added another 30-50 hours.

        <p class="development-info">
          HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
          <br>I did not use a single framework, although they would've helped me out drastically.
          I spent so much time getting the floating labels to work for each field, as well as the proper formatting.
