        <h3>Hey!</h3>
        <p>I'm an indie dev.
          <br>Everything I've released so far (and will continue to release, unless noted otherwise) is made by just me, one person.
          
          <br><br>I spend a lot of my free time making things that I wish existed, that I would use myself.
            You can read more about the process behind my projects by clicking the "Learn More" button on the <a href="./projects.html">Projects</a> tab! 
          
          <br><br>My favorite thing to make so far is games. I'm currently in the process of releasing "Whack 'em Moles" for Roku platforms, and I've also done a few small demo projects in Unity and Godot.
            I love the whole process and will be making more in the future! In the future, I'd love to make a 3D platformer that pays homage to the games I grew up with that's inspired me, my interests, and my personality.
          
          <br><br>My goal with everything I make is to keep things as simple as possible: the tech stack involved, and also the experience for the user/players.
          <br>I'm a user of my own software too! While requirements like a constant Internet connection and user accounts are necessary for a lot of products, I try to avoid them in my software. They can be a headache to create!
            I just want to make things that are easy to use, and easy to understand.
          
          <br><br>I like developing for platforms that people don't immediately think of, which was partly the inspiration for my first two published projects:
          <br><a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/study-mode-youtube/hhjnoabnlicjpahfibejifhankpfahnd" target="_blank">Study Mode: YouTube</a> as a Google Chrome + Mozilla Firefox browser extension, and
            my most recent <a href="https://channelstore.roku.com/details/787570feee5bb191a284792b90155109:b87ee48551388d2ede576612701225d2/whack-em-moles" target="_blank">Whack 'em Moles</a> game for Roku platforms!
          
          <br><br>A lot of the technology we all use on a daily basis have open platforms for developers.
          <br>Home assistants, smart watches, smart TVs, smart fridges (and the ever-growing list of smart-devices), and even your favorite retro consoles can all be developed for!
            Enthusiasts exist in every community that love seeing others write software that keeps their beloved platforms alive. Doing this gives much more organic user/player experiences.
            It's a lot of fun! I'd recommend anyone even remotely interested to spend a few hours trying it out (even if it's just displaying a message on the screen).
            Worst-case, even if you aren't able to make anything, you'll develop more of an appreciation for the technology as well as the other hobbyist developers.

          <br><br>I've got a programming background (bachelor of computer science) and a few years of industry experience, but love all aspects of creating &mdash; music and art especially!
            I've played guitar for most of my life, and drums for quite a bit too.
            I've always wanted to push myself to record music, and recording sound effects or a mini song for a project is the easiest way I can do that.  
          <br>I'm not an expert in anything; I love bouncing around to different platforms far too much to lock myself into one technology.
      
          <br><br>If you'd like to donate, my <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/emdhdev">donation link is here!</a>
            I write software for the love of the process and don't make any money unless I release it for a price, like a paid game.
          
          <br><br><br>Thank you for visiting, and thank you a million if you've ever used anything I've made! Support indie devs, indie music, indie authors, and indie art!
