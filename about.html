      <h1>About</h1>

      <h3>Hey!</h3>
      <p>I'm an indie dev.
        <br>Everything I've released so far (and will continue to release, unless noted otherwise) is made by just me, one person.
        
        <br><br>I spend a lot of my free time making things that I wish existed, that I would love to use.
        <br>My favorite thing to make so far is games. I'm currently in the process of releasing "Whack 'em Moles" for Roku platforms, and I've also done a few small demo projects in Unity and Godot.
          I love the whole process and will be making more in the future!
        
        <br><br>My goal with everything I make is to keep things as simple as possible: the tech stack involved, and also the experience for the user/players.
        <br>I'm a user of my own software too!
        <br>While things like a constant Internet connection and user accounts are necessary for a lot of products, I try to avoid them in my software. They can be a headache to create!
          I just want to make things that are easy to use, and easy to understand.
        <br>
        <br>I like developing for platforms that people don't immediately think of, which was partly the inspiration for my first two published projects:
        <br><a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/study-mode-youtube/hhjnoabnlicjpahfibejifhankpfahnd">Study Mode: YouTube</a> as a Google Chrome + Firefox browser extension, and
          my upcoming <a href="https://roku.com/">Whack 'em Moles</a> game for Roku platforms!
        <br>If you look around at every piece of technology you're using on a daily basis, you'd be surprised the platforms you can make things for.
        <br>Home assistants, smart watches, smart TVs, smart fridges (and the ever-growing list of smart-devices), and even your favorite retro consoles can all be developed for!
          Enthusiasts are in every community that love seeing others keep their beloved platforms alive, so you'll wind up getting more organic user/player experiences.

        <br><br>I've got a programming background (bachelor of computer science), but love all aspects of creating &mdash; music and art especially!
        <br>I've played guitar for most of my life, and drums for quite a bit too.
        I've always wanted to push myself to record music, and recording sound effects or a mini song for a project is the easiest way I can do that.  
        <br>I'm not an expert in anything; I love bouncing around to different platforms far too much to lock myself into one technology.
    
        <br><br>If you'd like to donate, my <a href="https://google.com">INSERT LINK</a> is here!
          I make software for the love of it and don't make any money from it, unless I release it for a price (like a game).
        
        <br><br><br>Thank you for visiting, and thank you a million if you've ever used anything I've made! Support indie devs, indie music, indie authors, and indie art!
